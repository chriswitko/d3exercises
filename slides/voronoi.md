## D3.js supports Voronois

> In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other.

- This is rendered as SVG elements
- We could output to canvas as well


## Exercise 7, play around with the voronoi code

Not really an exercise, but allows you to experiment with voronois.
