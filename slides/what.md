Plug: **Expert Data Visualization with D3.js (Q1 2017)**


## What are we going to do
 
 - I'll introduce a subject (couple of minutes)
 - I'll Explain the exercise
 - You can fill in the blanks in the provided code.
 
```
// Step 2. We can also select multiple elements. Use d3.select and
//         d3.selectAll to see the difference when selecting all the
//         <li> elements, and use either classed or attr to set the class
//         of these elements to 'step2'.
d3.selectAll(...).classed(..., ...)
```

** *Don't hesitate to ask questions!* **


## We're going to try and cover...

 - Learn how D3.js binds data to DOM elements.
 - Make basic charts and diagrams
 - Visualize hierarchical data 
 - Show connected graphs
 - Combine gis/geo information with opendata
 - Make art with voronois


## What aren't we going to cover

D3.js is big, very big. We'll explore the basics for data visualization, but 
there is a whole lot more. Most important stuff we skip:

 - User interaction, mouse events, drag events.
 - Animations
 - Zooming & dragging
 - Streaming data
 - loading and queue data
