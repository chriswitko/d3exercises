## What is D3.js

> "D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using [HTML, SVG, and CSS](). 
D3's emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without 
tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful [visualization components]() 
and a [data-driven approach]() to DOM manipulation." --- *d3js.org*


## What is it not
 - **Not a charting library**: But provides the building blocks (see nvd3.js, Rickshaw.js, c3.js).
 - **Not a drawing library**: Doesn't draw data itself, uses SVG for visualization.
 - **Not an SVG abstraction layer**: Manipulates the DOM and SVG directly.
 - **Not a Canvas/WebGL library**: Minimal support for Canvas, for WebGL use Three.js.
 - **Not a framework**: Can be used with Angular 1/2, React, Vue.js, <insert framework>, is just a (very extensive) library.


## Online information
  - Lots of online resources, but check the version v4. vs v3.
  - API: https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md
    - Bit overwhelming.. until you understand D3.js

## Work by example  
  - Usually easier to work from examples
  - Best starting point: https://bl.ocks.org/
  - Most examples still use v3 however..
